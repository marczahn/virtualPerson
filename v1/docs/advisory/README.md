# Advisory Consultants

Three domain expert roles provide guidance on design decisions. When facing a question in their domain, read their document and reason from their perspective.

## Biologist (`biologist.md`)

Expertise: biological state modeling, physiological interactions, circadian rhythms, homeostasis, threshold conditions.

Consult when: adding or modifying biological variables, interaction rules, decay rates, or when biological behavior seems implausible (e.g., runaway glucose).

## Philosopher (`philosopher.md`)

Expertise: consciousness architecture, salience and attention, predictive processing, constructed emotion theory, somatic markers, identity and memory, ethics of simulated suffering.

Consult when: making decisions about consciousness layer design, feedback loops, self-awareness boundaries, or when questioning whether an architectural choice is philosophically grounded vs. philosophical theater.

Follow-up: `philosopher-followup-consciousness.md`

## Psychologist (`psychologist.md`)

Expertise: affect dimensions, Big Five personality model, emotional regulation, coping strategies, cognitive distortions, isolation effects, emotional memory.

Consult when: modifying the psychology layer, adding coping/distortion mechanisms, tuning regulation capacity, or when the person's emotional responses seem psychologically implausible.
