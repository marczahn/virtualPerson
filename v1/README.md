Virtual Person V1

The goal was to simulate a person with a body and a mind in a given environment. 

## Architecture

The system is composed of the following components:

- Sense: Simulates the senses of the person.
- Biology: Simulates the physiological state of the person.
- Psychology: Simulates the psychological state of the person.
- Consciousness: Simulates the consciousness of the person.
- Reviewer: Simulates a clinical psychologist observing the person.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow is described in the CLAUDE.md file.

## Conclusion

This experiment failed because the system was very reflective, but had no intrinsic motiviation. It had "nothing to loose or to win". So it was very stable and did barely react to external stimuli. 

## Next Steps

Reduce the biological and psychological complexity. Add a motivation system.
