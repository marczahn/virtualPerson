<objective>
Implement consciousness spontaneous-thought and continuity contracts under `v2/internal/consciousness`.

Output: deterministic tick-gated thought firing with urgency-dominant drive selection, guaranteed baseline associative drift path, and continuity buffer inclusion in prompt context.
</objective>

<execution>
1. Red phase: add failing tests for ticker due/not-due behavior, urgency-dominant thought category, baseline associative drift availability, and continuity buffer prompt inclusion.
2. Green phase: implement pure thought-selection and bounded continuity-buffer contracts with no infra coupling.
3. Verify: run package tests and full `v2` suite with `GOCACHE=/tmp/go-build`.
4. Sync requirements/state/continuity docs.
</execution>

<layer_check>
- Affected layers: Consciousness (primary), Motivation (consumed state contract).
- Boundary rule: `internal/consciousness` may consume `internal/motivation`; no reverse dependency introduced.
- New dependencies: none.
</layer_check>
