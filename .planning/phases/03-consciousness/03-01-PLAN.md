<objective>
Implement the first consciousness contracts under `v2/internal/consciousness`: prompt-state phenomenological translation and defensive parser scaffolding.

Output: deterministic prompt context builder from motivation state, plus robust parsing for `[STATE]`, `[ACTION]`, optional `[DRIVE]` tags with narrative stripping and fallback behavior.
</objective>

<execution>
1. Red phase: add failing tests for top-drive prompt translation, implicit goal framing, no raw-number language, and parser/fallback contracts.
2. Green phase: implement pure consciousness contract functions with no infra dependencies.
3. Verify: run package tests and full `v2` suite with `GOCACHE=/tmp/go-build`.
4. Sync planning/state docs and requirement statuses.
</execution>

<layer_check>
- Affected layers: Consciousness (primary), Motivation (consumed as input contract).
- Boundary rule: `internal/consciousness` may import `internal/motivation`; no reverse dependency introduced.
- New dependencies: none.
</layer_check>
