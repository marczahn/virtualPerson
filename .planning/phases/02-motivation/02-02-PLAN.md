<objective>
Implement the Motivation core as deterministic, side-effect free logic under `v2/internal/motivation`.

Output: stable `Compute(bio, personality, chronic) MotivationState` API with explicit drive formulas, deterministic active-goal selection, and pure action-candidate rules.
</objective>

<execution>
1. Red phase: write tests for determinism, clamp/range, monotonicity, personality modulation, tie-break behavior, and constraint-aware action candidates.
2. Green phase: implement motivation package with 5 drives, 7 personality multipliers, active-goal tie-break order, and action generation rules.
3. Verify: run package tests (`-v` and `-race`) and full suite (`go test ./...`).
4. Sync docs/state for completed requirements.
</execution>

<layer_check>
- Affected layers: Biology and Psychology (Motivation)
- Boundary rule: `internal/motivation` may depend on `internal/biology`; no reverse dependency introduced.
- New dependencies: none.
