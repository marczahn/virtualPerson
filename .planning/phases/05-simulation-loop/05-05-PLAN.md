<objective>
Implement an executable runtime entrypoint so v2 acts as a running virtual person, not only as package-level contracts.

Output: runnable binary with tick scheduler, input loop, graceful shutdown, and wiring for BIO/MOT/CON/FBK/orchestration/output components.
</objective>

<execution>
1. Red phase: add failing tests for runtime lifecycle: start, tick progression, input forwarding, and graceful stop with persisted in-memory state handoff.
2. Green phase: implement runtime wiring in `cmd/person` and infrastructure runtime loop using existing contracts.
3. Verify: run package tests and full `v2` suite with `GOCACHE=/tmp/go-build`.
4. Sync requirements/state/continuity docs.
</execution>

<layer_check>
- Affected layers: infrastructure + cmd composition root.
- Boundary rule: `cmd` wires dependencies only; business logic remains in internal packages.
- New dependencies: none.
</layer_check>
