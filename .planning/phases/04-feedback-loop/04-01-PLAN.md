<objective>
Implement first feedback-loop contracts under `v2/internal/consciousness`.

Output: deterministic absolute emotional pulse mapping from parsed `[STATE]` and deterministic bio-effect mapping for successful `[ACTION]` outcomes.
</objective>

<execution>
1. Red phase: add failing tests for absolute `[STATE]` pulse mapping and successful/blocked action bio effects.
2. Green phase: implement pure feedback mapping functions with no time/dt input and no infra coupling.
3. Verify: run package tests and full `v2` suite with `GOCACHE=/tmp/go-build`.
4. Sync requirements/state/continuity docs.
</execution>

<layer_check>
- Affected layers: Consciousness (primary), Biology (delta contract import), Motivation (action constants).
- Boundary rule: no reverse dependency introduced from lower layers to consciousness.
- New dependencies: none.
</layer_check>
