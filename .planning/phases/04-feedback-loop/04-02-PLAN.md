<objective>
Implement second feedback-loop contract slice under `v2/internal/consciousness`.

Output: deterministic parsed-drive override bridge for next-tick perception and deterministic per-action cooldown gating that rejects repeated actions inside cooldown windows.
</objective>

<execution>
1. Red phase: add failing tests for parsed `[DRIVE]` override application to next-tick motivation state and repeated-action cooldown rejection semantics.
2. Green phase: implement pure contract functions for parsed override bridge and cooldown-aware action outcome resolution with immutable cooldown state updates.
3. Verify: run package tests and full `v2` suite with `GOCACHE=/tmp/go-build`.
4. Sync requirements/state/continuity docs.
</execution>

<layer_check>
- Affected layers: Consciousness (primary), Motivation (types/constants consumed).
- Boundary rule: `internal/consciousness` may consume `internal/motivation`; no reverse dependency introduced.
- New dependencies: none.
</layer_check>
