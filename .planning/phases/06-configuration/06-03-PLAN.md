<objective>
Implement explicit initial-person profile and startup-state contracts so the virtual person starts from a defined, behaviorally meaningful baseline.

Output: profile schema defining baseline bio state, personality factors, stress/cortisol sensitivity, and required starting-context fields consumed at runtime startup.
</objective>

<execution>
1. Red phase: add failing tests for required startup fields, profile validation, and stress sensitivity factor impact on stress/cortisol-related bio effects.
2. Green phase: implement profile contracts and startup integration.
3. Verify: run package tests and full `v2` suite with `GOCACHE=/tmp/go-build`.
4. Sync requirements/state/continuity docs.
</execution>

<layer_check>
- Affected layers: configuration/profile contracts + runtime composition.
- Boundary rule: profile data is configuration input; domain behavior remains in existing layer packages.
- New dependencies: none.
</layer_check>
