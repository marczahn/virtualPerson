# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** The person must exhibit intrinsic motivation — visible drives, desires, and frustrations that emerge from the interplay between biological state, a reward/motivation system, and LLM-driven consciousness.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Biological Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Biological Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-19 — Roadmap created, all 41 v1 requirements mapped to 6 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Clean rebuild in v2/ directory — no code sharing with v1
- 7 personality factors replace Big Five (stress sensitivity, energy resilience, curiosity, self-observation, patience/frustration tolerance, risk aversion, social factor)
- Bio model reduced to 8-10 motivationally-relevant variables
- Hybrid motivation: code computes drives, LLM interprets under pressure
- Bio degradation slow-path must exceed homeostasis recovery rate when needs go unmet

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3 risk]: Phenomenological translation language is the highest-risk surface — exact phrasing that shifts LLM behavioral register at high drive intensities must be validated empirically. Budget iteration time.
- [Phase 4 risk]: dt=0 edge cases and feedback loop coupling errors are silent — plan explicit integration tests at dt=0 and dt=large on all feedback paths.
